          <h1>THE HISTORICAL   <span>JOURNEY </span></h1>
          <p>Established on September 22nd, 1998, under the visionary leadership of His Excellency John Evans Fiifi Atta Mills, the Sekondi-Takoradi Technical Institute (STTI), formerly known as Takoradi Vocational Training Institute (TVTI), has stood as a bastion of technical education in the Western Region of Ghana. It was the first Institution in the Western Region to be established under the then National Vocational Training Institute (NVTI). Conceived through a collaborative effort between the government of Ghana and the Department for International Development (DFID) project, STTI was envisioned to provide the best employable Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) skills to the youth of the region. This led to the formation of TVTI in the Western Region of Ghana.
            In 2021, a significant milestone was achieved as Takoradi Vocational Training Institute (TVTI) underwent a transformation, emerging as the Sekondi-Takoradi Technical Institute. This transition, mandated by the government's Pre-Tertiary Education Act, 2020 (Act 1049), marked a new chapter in the institute's journey, aligning it with the evolving educational landscape and establishing it under the Ghana Technical and Vocational Education and Training Service (Ghana TVET Service).

          <h2>LOCATION</h2>
          <p>
            Nestled in the heart of Takoradi, along Rose-heart road (Type C), STTI occupies a strategic location, opposite the Electricity Company of Ghana Regional office, adjacent to the Labour office Takoradi, on the path to GSTS - Harbour Road. This prime location facilitates accessibility and underscores the institute's commitment to serving the community and the nation at large.
  
            
            As we reflect on the illustrious history of STTI, we pay homage to the succession of managers and principals who have steered the institute towards greatness. From K.

                      <p>The various symbols in our school logo are uniquely explained below:</p>
                      <p><strong>The Engineering Wheel</strong> signifies that STTI is fundamentally an engineering training school. We transform unskilled individuals into skilled engineers. The human figure holding tools represents the journey from novice to expert, as students evolve into master craftspeople skilled in their chosen fields. Many graduates have established their own businesses or secured roles in industries such as mining, oil, ports, and the Ghana Armed Forces. Others have pursued further education, advancing to the tertiary level.</p>
                      <p><strong>The Book with a Light</strong> signifies that our training institute is a Centre for acquiring knowledge. Aside from acquiring skills, STTI equips people with knowledge in areas such as Mathematics, Science, ICT, Entrepreneurship, Social Studies, and English Language, preparing our students for the workforce and ensuring successful living as well as academic progression into higher education.</p>
                      <p><strong>The Blue Sea with an Oil Drop</strong> indicates the location of the Institute (Takoradi, the Oil City) around the seashore and in an oil-rich region of Ghana. This location affords the institute special privileges, including immediate employment after school, partnerships with various industries, and the benefit of enjoying city life.</p>
                      <p><strong>Colors in the Logo:</strong> 
                          <ul>
                              <li><strong>Blue</strong> represents TVET, producing "blue-collar" jobs.</li>
                              <li><strong>Gold</strong> signifies the wealth produced by STTI or TVET.</li>
                          </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>STTI was established in 1998. The logo conveys the message: “Nsano Ndwuma Hen Mpuntu” (Skills acquisition brings about economic benefits). This means that the skilled individuals produced by STTI or TVET in the oil city of Takoradi will propel development and wealth for themselves, their communities, Ghana, and the world at large.</p>
